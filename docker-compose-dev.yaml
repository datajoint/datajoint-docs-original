#
# Intended for normal development. Does not currently supports hot/live reloading. To reflect
# new updates will need to docker-compose down -> up. MODE=TEST will build using single
# branch config passed into env variables i.e. faster (see docker-compose-build.yaml).
# MODE=PROD will use all versions included in build_version.json.
# Note: If requirements or Dockerfile change, will need to add --build flag to docker-compose.
# Make sure to add an entry into your /etc/hosts file as `127.0.0.1 fakeservices.datajoint.io`
# This serves as an alias for the domain to resolve locally.
# With this config and the configuration below in NGINX, you should be able to verify it is
# running properly by navigating in your browser to `https://fakeservices.datajoint.io`.
# If you don't update your hosts file, you will still have access at `https://localhost`
# however it should simply display 'Not secure' since the cert will be invalid.
