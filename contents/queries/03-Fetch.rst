Fetch
=====

Data queries in DataJoint comprise two distinct steps:

1. Construct the ``query`` object to represent the required data using tables and :ref:`operators`.
2. Fetch the data from ``query`` into the workspace of the host language -- described in this section.

Fetch works somewhat differently between MATLAB and Python.

Note that entities returned by ``fetch`` methods are not guaranteed to be sorted in any particular order unless specifically requested.
Furthermore, the order is not guaranteed to be the same in any two queries, and the contents of two identical queries may change between two sequential invocations unless they are wrapped in a transaction.
Therefore, if you wish to fetch matching pairs of attributes, do so in one ``fetch`` call.

The examples below are based on the :ref:`example schema <query-example>` for this part of the documentation.

MATLAB
------

DataJoint for MATLAB provides three distinct fetch methods: ``fetch``, ``fetch1``, and ``fetchn``.
The three methods differ by the type and number of their returned variables.

``query.fetch`` returns the result in the form of an *n* â¨‰ 1  `struct array <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/struct.html>`_ where *n*.

``query.fetch1`` and ``query.fetchn`` split the result into separate output arguments, one for each attribute of the query.

The types of the variables returned by ``fetch1`` and ``fetchn`` depend on the :ref:`datatypes` of the attributes.
``query.fetchn`` will enclose any attributes of  char and blob types in  `cell arrays <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/cell-arrays.html>`_ whereas ``query.fetch1`` will unpack them.

MATLAB has two alternative forms of invoking a method on an object: using the dot notation or passing the object as the first argument.
The following two notations produce an equivalent result:

.. code-block:: matlab

    result = query.fetch(query, 'attr1')
    result = fetch(query, 'attr1')

However, the dot syntax only works when the query object is already assigned to a variable.
The second syntax is more commonly used to avoid extra variables.

For example, the two methods below are equivalent although the second method creates an extra variable.

.. code-block:: matlab

    # Method 1
    result = fetch(university.Student, '*');

    # Method 2
    query = university.Student;
    result = query.fetch()


Fetch the primary key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Without any arguments, the ``fetch`` method retrieves the primary key values of the table in the form of a single column ``struct``.
The attribute names become the fieldnames of the ``struct``.

.. code-block:: matlab

    keys = query.fetch;
    keys = fetch(university.Student & university.StudentMajor);

Note that MATLAB allows calling functions without the parentheses ``()``.


Fetch entire query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a single-quoted asterisk (``'*'``) as the input argument, the ``fetch`` command retrieves the entire result as a struct array.

.. code-block:: matlab

    data = query.fetch('*');

    data = fetch(university.Student & university.StudentMajor, '*');

In some cases, the amount of data returned by fetch can be quite large.
When ``query`` is a table object rather than a query expression, ``query.sizeOnDisk()`` reports the estimated size of the entire table.
It can be used to assess whether running ``query.fetch('*')`` would be wise.
Please note that it is only currently possible to query the size of entire tables stored directly in the database .

As separate variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``fetch1`` and ``fetchn`` methods are used to retrieve each attribute into a separate variable.
We need two different methods to tell MATLAB whether the result should be in array or scalar form; for numerical fields it does not matter (because scalars are still matrices in matlab) but non-uniform collections of values must be enclosed in cell arrays.

``query.fetch1`` is used when ``query``  contains exactly one entity, otherwise ``fetch1`` will raise an error.

``query.fetchn`` returns an arbitrary number of elements with character arrays and blobs returned in the form of cell arrays, even when  ``query`` happens to contain a single entity.

.. code-block:: matlab

    % when tab has exactly one entity:
    [name, img] = query.fetch1('name', 'image');

    % when tab has any number of entities:
    [names, imgs] = query.fetchn('name', 'image');


Obtaining the primary key along with individual values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is often convenient to know the primary key values corresponding to attribute values retrieved by ``fetchn``.
This can be done by adding a special input argument indicating the request and another output argument to receive the key values:

.. code-block:: matlab

    % retrieve names, images, and corresponding primary key values:
    [names, imgs, keys] = query.fetchn('name', 'image', 'KEY');

The resulting value of ``keys`` will be a column array of type ``struct``.
This mechanism is only implemented for ``fetchn``.

Rename and calculate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In DataJoint for MATLAB, all ``fetch`` methods have all the same capability as the :ref:`proj` operator.
For example, renaming an attribute can be accomplished using the syntax below.

.. code-block:: matlab

    [names, BMIs] = query.fetchn('name', 'weight/height/height -> bmi');

See :ref:`proj` for an in-depth description of projection.

Sorting and limiting the results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To sort the result, add the additional ``ORDER BY`` argument in ``fetch`` and ``fetchn`` methods as the last argument.

.. code-block:: matlab

    % retrieve field ``course_name`` from courses
    % in the biology department, sorted by course number
    notes = fetchn(university.Course & 'dept="BIOL"', 'course_name', ...
         'ORDER BY course');

The ORDER BY argument is passed directly to SQL and follows the same syntax as the `ORDER BY clause <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/order-by-optimization.html>`_

Similarly, the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses can be used to limit the result to a subset of entities.
For example, to return the most advanced courses, one could do the following:

.. code-block:: matlab

    s = fetch(university.Course, '*', 'ORDER BY course DESC LIMIT 5')

The limit clause is passed directly to SQL and follows the same `rules <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html>`_

Python
------

Entire table
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following statement retrieves the entire table as a NumPy `recarray <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.recarray.html>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    data = query.fetch()

To retrieve the data as a list of ``dict``:

.. code-block:: python

    data = query.fetch(as_dict=True)

Furthermore, the ``query`` object can be used as a generator for loops:

.. code-block:: python

    for row in query:
       # row is a dict
       print(row)

In some cases, the amount of data returned by fetch can be quite large; in these cases it can be useful to use the ``size_on_disk`` attribute to determine if running a bare fetch would be wise.
Please note that it is only currently possible to query the size of entire tables stored directly in the database at this time.

As separate variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    name, img = query.fetch1('name', 'image')  # when tab has exactly one entity
    name, img = query.fetch('name', 'image')  # [name, ...] [image, ...]

Primary key values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    keydict = tab.fetch1("KEY")  # single key dict when tab has exactly one entity
    keylist = tab.fetch("KEY")  # list of key dictionaries [{}, ...]

Usage with Pandas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``pandas`` `library <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ is a popular library for data analysis in Python which can easily be used with DataJoint query results.
Since the records returned by ``fetch()`` are contained within a ``numpy.recarray``, they can be easily converted to ``pandas.DataFrame`` objects by passing them into the ``pandas.DataFrame`` constructor.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    frame = pd.DataFrame(tab.fetch())

.. python 1 end
