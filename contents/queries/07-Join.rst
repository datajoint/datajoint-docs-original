Join
====

Join operator ``*``
-------------------

The Join operator ``A * B`` combines the matching information in ``A`` and ``B``.
The result contains all matching combinations of entities from both arguments.

Principles of joins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The operands ``A`` and ``B`` must be **join-compatible**.
2. The primary key of the result is the union of the primary keys of the operands.

Examples of joins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example 1 : When the operands have no common attributes, the result is the cross product -- all combinations of entities.

Example 2 : When the operands have common attributes, only entities with matching values are kept.

Example 3 : Joining on secondary attribute.

Properties of join
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. When ``A`` and ``B`` have the same attributes, the join ``A * B`` becomes equivalent to the set intersection ``A`` âˆ© ``B``.
   Hence, DataJoint does not need a separate intersection operator.

2. Commutativity: ``A * B`` is equivalent to ``B * A``.

3. Associativity: ``(A * B) * C`` is equivalent to ``A * (B * C)``.
