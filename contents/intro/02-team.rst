Teamwork 
========

Findings-centered workflow
--------------------------

Commonly, life science labs and neuroscience labs in particular organize their workflow as a sequence of activities of experiment design, data acquisition, and processing and analysis.

Published findings are accompanied by data supporting the findings. 
Publishers require that published data conform to `FAIR principles <https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618>`_ to promote validity of findings. 
The way most labs organize their work, data are prepared for publishing before submitting 


Data-centric workflow 
---------------------

DataJoint is designed to support a different, data-centric approach. 
Data are viewed as the principal output of research.
