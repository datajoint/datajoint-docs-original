Install and Connect
===================

.. matlab 1 start

MATLAB
------

1. Download the DataJoint Toolbox from the `MATLAB Central FileExchange <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/63218-datajoint>`_.
2. Open ``DataJoint.mltbx`` and follow installation instructions.
3. After installation, from MATLAB, verify that you have the latest version of DataJoint (3.0.0 or above):
   ::

     >> dj.version
     DataJoint version 3.0.0
4. At the MATLAB command prompt, assign the environment variables with the database credentials.
   For example, if you are connection to the server ``alicelab.datajoint.io`` with username ``alice`` and password ``haha not my real password``, execute the following commands:
   ::

     setenv DJ_USER alice
     setenv DJ_HOST alicelab.datajoint.io
     setenv DJ_PASS 'haha not my real password'

You will need to execute these commands at the beginning of each DataJoint work session.
To automate this process, you might like to use the `startup.m <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html>`_ script.

However, be careful not to share this file or commit it to a public directory (a common mistake), as it contains a your login credentials in plain text.
If you are not sure, it is better not to set ``DJ_PASS``, in which case DataJoint will prompt to enter the password when connecting to the database.

To change the database password, use the following command

::

    >> dj.setPassword('my#cool!new*psswrd')

And update your credentials in your startup script for the next session.
.. matlab 1 end

.. python 1 start

Python
------

DataJoint is implemented for Python 3.4+.
You may install it from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/datajoint>`_:

::

    pip3 install datajoint

or upgrade

::

    pip3 install --upgrade datajoint

Next configure the connection through DataJoint's ``config`` object:

.. code:: python

    In [1]: import datajoint as dj
    DataJoint 0.4.9 (February 1, 2017)
    No configuration found. Use `dj.config` to configure and save the configuration.

You may now set the database credentials:

.. code:: python

    In [2]: dj.config['database.host'] = "alicelab.datajoint.io"
    In [3]: dj.config['database.user'] = "alice"
    In [4]: dj.config['database.password'] = "haha not my real password"

Skip setting the password to make DataJoint prompt to enter the password every time.

You may save the configuration in the local work directory with ``dj.config.save_local()`` or for all your projects in ``dj.config.save_global()``.

You may leave the user or the password as ``None``, in which case you will be prompted to enter them manually for every session.

Note that the system environment variables ``DJ_HOST``, ``DJ_USER``, and ``DJ_PASS`` will overwrite the settings in the config file.
You can use them to set the connection credentials instead of config files.

To change the password, the ``dj.set_password`` function will walk you through the process:

::

    >>> dj.set_password()

After that, update the password in the configuration and save it as described above:

.. code:: python

    dj.config['database.password'] = 'my#cool!new*psswrd'
    dj.config.save_local()   # or dj.config.save_global()

If ``dj.config['database.password']`` is set to ``NULL``, DataJoint will prompt to enter the password when connecting to the server.
.. python 1 end
