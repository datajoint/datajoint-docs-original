DataJoint Python Windows Install Guide
======================================

This document outlines the steps necessary to install DataJoint on Windows for use in connecting to a remote server hosting a DataJoint database.
Some limited discussion of installing MySQL is discussed in `MySQL for Windows`_, but is not covered in-depth since this is an uncommon usage scenario and not strictly required to connect to DataJoint pipelines.

Quick steps
-----------

Quick install steps for advanced users are as follows:

- Install latest Python 3.x and ensure it is in ``PATH`` (3.6.3 current at time of writing)
- ``pip install datajoint``

For ERD drawing support:

- Install Graphviz for Windows and ensure it is in ``PATH`` (64 bit builds currently tested; URL below.)
- ``pip install pydotplus matplotlib``

Detailed instructions follow.

Step 1: install Python
----------------------

Python for Windows is available from:

https://www.python.org/downloads/windows

The latest 64 bit 3.x version, currently 3.6.3, `is available from the Python site <https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.3/python-3.6.3-amd64.exe>`_.

From here run the installer to install Python.

For a single-user machine, the regular installation process is sufficient - be sure to select the ``Add Python to PATH`` option:

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/install-python-simple.png

For a shared machine, run the installer as administrator (right-click, run as administrator) and select the advanced installation.
Be sure to select options as follows:

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/install-python-advanced-1.png
.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/install-python-advanced-2.png

Step 2: verify installation
---------------------------

To verify the Python installation and make sure that your system is ready to install DataJoint, open a command window by entering ``cmd`` into the Windows search bar:

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/cmd-prompt.png

From here ``python`` and the Python package manager ``pip`` can be verified by running ``python -V`` and ``pip -V``, respectively:

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/verify-python-install.png

If you receive the error message that either ``pip`` or ``python`` is not a recognized command, please uninstall Python and ensure that the option to add Python to the ``PATH`` variable was properly configured.

Step 3: install DataJoint
-------------------------

DataJoint (and other Python modules) can be easily installed using the ``pip`` Python package manager which is installed as a part of Python and was verified in the previous step.

To install DataJoint simply run ``pip install datajoint``:

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/install-datajoint-1.png

This will proceed to install DataJoint, along with several other required packages from the PIP repository.
When finished, a summary of the activity should be presented:

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/install-datajoint-2.png

.. note:: You can find out more about the packages installed here and many other freely available open source packages via `pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_, the Python package index site.

(Optional) step 4: install packages for ERD support
---------------------------------------------------

To draw ERD diagrams of your DataJoint schema, the following additional steps should be followed.

Install Graphviz
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

DataJoint currently utilizes `Graphviz <http://graphviz.org>`_ to generate the ERD visualizations.
Although a Windows version of Graphviz is available from the main site, it is an older and out of date 32-bit version, so we recommend using the pre-release builds of the 64 bit version, which are available here:

https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ellson/graphviz-pl238

More specifically, we use the build artifacts from the ``Win64; Configuration: Release`` which are available `here <https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/hlkclpfhf6gnakjq/artifacts/build%2FGraphviz-install.exe>`_.

This is a regular Windows installer executable, and will present a dialog when starting:

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/install-graphviz-1.png

It is important that an option to place Graphviz in the ``PATH`` be selected.

For a personal installation:

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/install-graphviz-2a.png

To install system wide:

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/install-graphviz-2b.png

Once installed, Graphviz can be verified from a fresh command window as follows:

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/verify-graphviz-install.png

If you receive the error message that the ```dot`` program is not a recognized command, please uninstall Graphviz and ensure that the
option to add Python to the PATH variable was properly configured.

.. important:: in some cases, running the ``dot -c`` command in a command prompt is required to properly initialize the Graphviz installation.

Install PyDotPlus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PyDotPlus library links the Graphviz installation to DataJoint and is easily installed via ``pip``:

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/install-pydotplus.png

Install Matplotlib
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Matplotlib library provides useful plotting utilities which are also used by DataJoint's ERD drawing facility.
The package is easily installed via ``pip``:

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/install-matplotlib.png

(Optional) step 5: install Jupyter Notebook
-------------------------------------------

As described on `the jupyter.org website <http://jupyter.org>`_:

..

  'The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows
  you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations,
  visualizations and narrative text.'

Although not a part of DataJoint, Jupyter Notebook can be a very useful tool for building and interacting with DataJoint pipelines.
It is easily installed from ``pip`` as well:

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/install-jupyter-1.png
.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/install-jupyter-2.png

Once installed, Jupyter Notebook can be started via the ``jupyter notebook`` command, which should now be on your path:

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/verify-jupyter-install.png

By default Jupyter Notebook will start a local private webserver session from the directory where it was started and start a web browser session connected to the session.

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/run-jupyter-1.png
.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/run-jupyter-2.png

You now should be able to use the notebook viewer to navigate the filesystem and to create new project folders and interactive Jupyter/Python/DataJoint notebooks.

Git for Windows
---------------

The `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ version control system is not a part of DataJoint but is recommended for interacting with the broader Python/Git/GitHub sharing ecosystem.

The Git for Windows installer is available from `https://git-scm.com/download/win <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`_.

.. image:: ../_static/img/windows/install-git-1.png

The default settings should be sufficient and correct in most cases.

MySQL for Windows
-----------------

For hosting pipelines locally, the MySQL server package is required.

MySQL for windows can be installed via the installers available from the `MySQL website <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/>`_.
Please note that although DataJoint should be fully compatible with a Windows MySQL server installation, this mode of operation is not tested by the DataJoint team.
