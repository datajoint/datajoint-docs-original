Primary Key
===========

Primary keys in DataJoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Entities in tables are neither named nor numbered.
Questions of the kind "What is the 10th element of this table?" are foreign to the relational mindset.
Instead, entities are distinguished and identified by their values.
Furthermore, the entire entity is not required for identification.
In each table, a subset of its attributes are designated to be the **primary key**.
Attributes in the primary key alone are sufficient to differentiate any entity from any other within the table.

Each table must have exactly one `primary key <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key>`__: a subset of its attributes that uniquely identify each entity in the table.
The database uses the primary key to prevent duplicate entries, to relate data across tables, and to accelerate data queries.
The choice of the primary key will determine how you identify entities.
Therefore, make the primary key **short**, **expressive**, and **persistent**.

For example, mice in our lab are assigned unique IDs.
The mouse ID number ``animal_id`` of type ``smallint`` can serve as the primary key for the table ``Mice``.
An experiment performed on a mouse may be identified in the table ``Experiments`` by two attributes: ``animal_id`` and ``experiment_number``.

DataJoint takes the concept of primary keys somewhat more seriously than other models and query languages.
Even **table expressions**, i.e. those tables produced through operations on other tables, have a well-defined primary key.
All operators on tables are designed in such a way that the results always have a well-defined primary key.

In all representations of tables in DataJoint, the primary key attributes are always listed before other attributes and highlighted for emphasis (e.g. in a **bold** font or marked with an asterisk \*)

Defining a primary key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In table declarations, the primary key attributes always come first and are separated from the other attributes with a line containing at least three hyphens.
For example, the following is the definition of a table containing database users where ``username`` is the primary key.

::

    ## database users
    username : varchar(20)   # unique user name
    ---
    first_name : varchar(30)
    last_name  : varchar(30)
    role : enum('admin', 'contributor', 'viewer')

Entity integrity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary key defines and enforces the desired property of databases known as **entity integrity**.
Entity integrity is the guarantee made by the data management process that entities from the real world are reliably and uniquely represented in the database system.
In a proper relational design, each table represents a collection of discrete real-world entities of some kind.
Entity integrity states that the data management process must prevent any confusion between entities such as duplication or misidentification.

To enforce entity integrity, DataJoint implements several rules:
* Every table must have a primary key.
* Primary key attributes cannot have default values (with the exception of ``auto_increment`` and ``CURRENT_TIMESTAMP``; see below).
* Operators on tables are defined with respect to the primary key and preserve a primary key in their results.

Datatypes in primary keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All integer types, dates, timestamps, and short character strings make good primary key attributes.
Character strings are somewhat less suitable because they can be long and because they may have invisible trailing spaces.
Floating-point numbers should be avoided because rounding errors may lead to misidentification of entities.
Enums are okay as long as they do not need to be modified after :doc:`foreign keys <10-Foreign-Keys>` are already created referencing the table.
Finally, DataJoint does not support blob types in primary keys.

The primary key may be composite, i.e. comprising several attributes.
In DataJoint, hierarchical designs often produce tables whose primary keys comprise many attributes.

Natural primary keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A primary key comprising real-world attributes is a `natural primary key <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_key>`__.
Natural primary keys are a good choice when such real-world attributes are already properly assigned and their permanence is ensured.
If no convenient natural key exists, an artificial attribute may be created whose purpose is to uniquely identify entities in the real world.
An institutional process must ensure the uniqueness and permanence of such an identifier.
For example, the U.S. government assigns every worker an identifying attribute, the social security number.
However, the government must go to great lengths to ensure that this primary key is assigned exactly once, by checking against other less convenient candidate keys (i.e. the combination of name, parents' names, date of birth, place of birth, etc.).
Just like the SSN, well managed primary keys tend to get institutionalized and find multiple uses.

Your lab must maintain a system for uniquely identifying important entities.
For example, experiment subjects and experiment protocols must have unique IDs.
Use these as the primary keys in the corresponding tables in your DataJoint databases.

Surrogate primary keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are cases when a special attribute may be added to play the role of the primary key that is never used outside the database.
These primary keys are called **surrogate primary keys**.
Below are some cases when surrogate keys are appropriately used.

Using hashes as primary keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some tables include too many attributes in their primary keys.
For example, the stimulus condition in a psychophysics experiment may have a dozen parameters such that a change in any one of them makes a different valid stimulus condition.
In such a case, all the attributes would need to be included in the primary key to ensure entity integrity.
However, long primary keys make it difficult to reference individual tuples.
To be most useful, primary keys need to be relatively short.

This problem is effectively solved through the use of a hash of all the identifying attributes as the surrogate primary key.
For example, MD5 or SHA-1 hash algorithms can be used for this purpose.
To keep their representations human-readable, they may be encoded in base-64 ASCII.
For example, the 128-bit MD5 hash can be represented by 21 base-64 ASCII characters, but for many applications, taking the first 8 to 12 characters is sufficient to avoid collisions.

``auto_increment``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some entities are created by the very action of being entered into the database.
The action of entering them into the database gives them their identity.
It is impossible to duplicate them since entering the same thing twice still means creating two distinct entities.

In such cases, the use of an auto-incremented primary key is warranted.
These are declared by adding the word ``auto_increment`` after the data type in the declaration.
The datatype must be an integer.
Then the database will assign incrementing numbers at each insert.

The example definition below defines an auto-incremented primary key

::

    ## log entries
    entry_id  :  smallint auto_increment
    ---
    entry_text :  varchar(4000)
    entry_time = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP : timestamp(3)  # automatic timestamp with millisecond precision

DataJoint passes ``auto_increment`` behavior to the underlying MySQL and therefore it has the same limitation: it can only be used for tables with a single attribute in the primary key.

If you need to auto-increment an attribute in a composite primary key, you will need to do so programmatically within a transaction to avoid collisions.

For example, letâ€™s say that you want to auto-increment ``scan_idx`` in a table called ``Scan`` whose primary key is ``(animal_id, session, scan_idx)``.
You must already have the values for ``animal_id`` and ``session`` in the dictionary ``key``.
Then you can do the following.

.. code:: python

    key['scan_idx'] = (Scan() & key).proj(next='max(scan_idx)+1').fetch1['next']

.. code:: matlab

    key.scah_idx = fetch1(Scan & key, 'next=max(scan_idx)+1')
