Deleting from part tables
-------------------------
Entities in a :ref:`part table <part>` are usually removed as a consequence of calling ``delete`` on the master table.
To enforce this workflow, calling ``delete`` directly on a part table produces an error.
In some cases, it may be necessary to override this behavior.
To remove entities from a part table without calling ``delete`` master, use the argument ``force=True``.
