Manipulation
============

Data **manipulation** operations change the state of the data stored in the database without modifying the structure of the stored data.
These operations include :ref:`insert <insert>`, :ref:`delete <delete>`, and :ref:`update <update>`.

Data manipulation operations in DataJoint respect the :ref:`integrity <integrity>` constraints.
